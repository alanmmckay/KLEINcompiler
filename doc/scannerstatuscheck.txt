1) List of Token Types
    -WORD
    -KEYWORD
    -LITERAL
    -OPERATOR
    -DELIMITER

2) Examples:

    -WORD and KEYWORD: Anything which acts as a user-defined identifier. x, X, 
xX, testFunction, and so on. WORDS may not have whitespace in them. These may 
not be longer than 256 characters, and must begin with a letter while being 
composed of a combination of letters, digits, and the underscore. It's worth 
noting a keyword is not a word. So integer, boolean, true, false, if, then, 
else, not, and, or, and function are not words. main and print are both words, 
but they are primitive in the sense that they have pre-defined values associated 
with them. 

    -LITERAL: Data represented without an identifier. Any integer value in the 
range of -2^31 to 2^31-1. true and false are both primitive boolean literals 
which represent 1 and 0 respectively.

    -OPERATOR: +, -, *, /, <, =. The set of punctuation marks which perform 
mathematical operations or assignment operations.  This is a pretty rigid set of 
tokens. Any that are not in this list is not an operator. For example, ++ is not 
an operator. The usage of - in conjunction with a literal indicates the 
operation of 0-literal.

    -DELIMITER: (, ), (*, *), ,. Expressions which expresses a change in 
syntactic expectation. For example, a left parenthesis lets the compiler know 
that a parameter or argument is expected, where the right parenthesis lets the 
compiler know to no longer expect either of these two.
